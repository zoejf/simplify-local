        Local business and featured product data is currently being pulled from the Groupon web site. We plan to incorporate the Groupon API in order to get the most up-to-date business information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our other goals for the future would be to create a more curated collection of verified local businesses. We would partner with local businesses that want their products featured on the site and allow them to add featured products themselves.
